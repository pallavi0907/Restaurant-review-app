# Restaurant Review App

The goal of this project is to implement Responsive design, service worker to cache and Accessibilty.

#Project Overview

*For the Restaurant Reviews project, we have to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, this project is a static design that lacks accessibility and need to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. There is also need to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
